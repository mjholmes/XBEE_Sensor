A simple distributed sensor board to measure temperature using a TMP36 with connectors to allow additional sensors to be fitted. All
the sensing is done using the XBEE onboard ADC.
With the correct XBEE settings it will run for about 10months off 2 AA alkaline batteries sampling one or tow sensors and battery
voltage once every couple of minutes.
